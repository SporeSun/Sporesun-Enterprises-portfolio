      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a bachelor's of clinical psychology from California State University, Dominguez Hills. I am 33 years old and very proudly neurodivergent. I have been involved in the mental health field for nearly 4 years professionally and 12 years personally, but have been looking to make a pivot to a career that combines my love of computers with the act of creation. I have also been running a gourmet and medicinal mushroom farm for 8 years, and have been actively involved in social justice activism in and around Orange County, CA. My focus for social justice is harm reduction initiatives, because policies around prohibition have destroyed people's lives and leave many vulnerable.

        My goal as a web developer is to become fully mobile while entirely supporting myself through van life. I wish to be able to set myself up anywhere without much trouble, and delve into the adventure much of my 20s missed thanks to my neurodivergent struggles and misdirection by academic institutions.

        Yes, I will get this bio fixed by career services eventually, but I thought y'all should actually know me.
